This is a command-line tool inspired by "git-bisect", which allows you to
perform binary searches among the revisions of a subversion project.

There's lots of documentation in the "svn-bisect" file.  Author, usage,
screenshot, license, it's all in there.  Please run "perldoc svn-bisect" to
read it.  If you don't have a "perldoc" command, you can just open it in your
favorite pager or text editor, or maybe even your web browser.  Or, if it has
been installed properly, you could try "svn-bisect help".
